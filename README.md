# üìã **Build in Public Journey - Detailed Plan**

Welcome to the **Physio & Client App** journey! This document lays out an end-to-end plan, from **idea to MVP**, **validation**, **launch**, and **scale**. It includes **how** we plan to build and **why** we‚Äôre building it.

---

## üöÄ **Mission Statement**
> Empower physiotherapists and patients with connected, data-driven tools that improve exercise adherence, track progress, and deliver better outcomes.

---

## üéØ **The Problem We're Solving**

| **For Patients** | **For Physiotherapists** |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Poor adherence to home exercises | No real-time visibility into patient progress |
| Lack of motivation and accountability | No structured way to assign home plans and follow-ups |
| Forgetting exercises or doing them incorrectly | Manual processes for monitoring and communication |
| No easy way to log pain or symptoms daily | Missed opportunities for intervention between sessions |
| No feedback or encouragement | Difficulty tracking adherence and results |
